abstract = {Revealing the misuse of network resources is one of the important fields in the network security, especially for the network administrators. One of them is the use of unauthorized NAT (Network Address Translation) devices (e.g. small office routers or wireless access points) inside the network which introduces serious security issues. There are several techniques proposed on how to detect NAT devices in the computer networks, but all these methods suffer from high false positive rate. Also there is no study how to perform NAT detection using NetFlow data, often used for monitoring and forensics analysis in large networks. The contribution of our work consists of the following: i) we have transformed existing NAT detection techniques to work with NetFlow data, ii) we propose three new NAT detection approaches , iii) we have designed a prototype of NAT detection system, which aggregates the results from various NAT detection techniques in order to minimize false positive and false negative rates.},

abstract = {Packet Sniffer is a tool which captures all the packets on the network irrespective of the final destination of the packet. Packet Sniffer could be used to monitor the bottlenecks in the network, alarm the irregular behaviour in the network, capture passwords and VoIP from any system in that network. This paper gives a brief introduction of what is a packet sniffer, its structure and what is its working. Then key features of top packet sniffing tools (i.e. Wireshark, TCPdump and Colasoft Capsa) are discussed. Further, the above tools are compared on the basis of characteristic behaviour and quantitative parameters. Finally, one gets the best tool amongst these three in a particular situation.},
